# 📂 File Integrity Checker

A simple and educational **file integrity checker**, developed by me (p8pc).

This project allows users to verify whether a file has been modified by comparing cryptographic hashes. It demonstrates how integrity checks are used in cybersecurity and digital forensics.

The goal is to help understand how file integrity monitoring works in a clear and visual way.

### Designed for:

* Cybersecurity learning 🛡️
* File integrity and forensics concepts 📂
* Developers and students 👨‍💻
* Educational demonstrations 📚

### Features

* File integrity verification using cryptographic hashing
* SHA-256 hash calculation
* Graphical file selection
* Clear result: unchanged or modified
* Clean graphical interface with custom background
* Lightweight and easy to use
* Runs fully offline

### Installation

No installation required.

This project is distributed as a **standalone Windows executable (.exe)**.  
Python and dependencies are already included in the executable.

### Usage

1. Download the `.exe` file.
2. Double-click to launch the application.
3. Select a file to analyze.
4. Compare the generated hash with a known value.
5. Instantly see whether the file has been modified.

### Security Notes

* Files are analyzed **locally only**
* No data is uploaded or shared
* No network access
* Intended for **educational and awareness purposes**
